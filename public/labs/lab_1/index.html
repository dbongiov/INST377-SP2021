        <ol>
            <li>21: This album by Adele is slow and perfect for a gloomy day</li>
            <li>Divide: This album by Ed Sheeran has many hits on it with great lyrics and melodies</li>
            <li>Songs About Jane: This album by Maroon5 has slow songs and upbeat songs for any situation</li>
            <li>Handwritten: This album by Shawn Mendes has a lot of fun, feel good songs that are great for blasting in the car</li>
            <li>Championships: This album by Meek Mill has a lot of pump-up songs that are great to listen to when working out</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Inline elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
