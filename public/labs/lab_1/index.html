        <h1>Domenic Bongiovanni's Lab 1</h1>
        <p>First, the basics.</p>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>Headings set your default page size</p>
        <img src='images/mochi.gif' alt= "gif mochi"/>
        <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt= "svg mochi"/>
        <img src='images/mochi.jpg' alt= "jpg mochi"/>
        <img src='images/mochi.png' alt= "png mochi"/>
        <p>Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here.</p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>Let's make an unordered list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I really like to play and watch soccer</li>
            <li>I play guitar in my freetime</li>
            <li>My favorite color is green</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And now, one in order.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>21: This album by Adele is slow and perfect for a gloomy day</li>
            <li>Divide: This album by Ed Sheeran has many hits on it with great lyrics and melodies</li>
            <li>Songs About Jane: This album by Maroon5 has slow songs and upbeat songs for any situation</li>
            <li>Handwritten: This album by Shawn Mendes has a lot of fun, feel good songs that are great for blasting in the car</li>
            <li>Championships: This album by Meek Mill has a lot of pump-up songs that are great to listen to when working out</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Inline elements</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> something in the text.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Sometimes you want to do both.</strong></em></p>
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
        <p>Add a hard line under here.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.</p>
